    "A correlation is a statistical relationship between two variables. If we wanted to know if vaccines work, we might look at the correlation between the use of the vaccine and whether it results in prevention of the infection or disease [1]. In this question, you are to see if there is a correlation between having had the chicken pox and the number of chickenpox vaccine doses given (varicella).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on interpreting the answer. If the had_chickenpox_column is either 1 (for yes) or 2 for no, and that the num_chickenpox_vaccine_column is the number of doses a child has been given of the varicella vaccine, then a positive correlation (e.g. corr > 0) would mean that an increase in had_chickenpox_column (which means more no's) would mean an increase in the num_chickenpox_vaccine_column (which means more doses of vaccine). If corr < 0 then there is a negative correlation, indicating that having had chickenpox is related to an increase in the number of vaccine doses. Also, pval refers to the probability the relationship observed is significant. In this case pval should be very very small (will end in e-18 indicating a very small number), which means the result unlikely to be by chance.\n",

    "[1] This isn't really the full picture, since we are not looking at when the dose was given. It's possible that children had chickenpox and then their parents went to get them the vaccine. Does this dataset have the data we would need to investigate the timing of the dose?"
